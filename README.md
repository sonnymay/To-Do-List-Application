# To-Do-List-Application

The To-Do List Application is a simple Python program that allows users to manage their tasks. Users can add tasks, mark tasks as completed, view their task list, and save their tasks for future use.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can add tasks to their to-do list by providing the task name, description, and due date.
- Mark tasks as completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, indicating that they have finished those tasks.
- View tasks: Users can view their list of tasks, including the task name, description, due date, and completion status.
- Save tasks: The application automatically saves the tasks to a file, allowing users to retrieve their tasks even after closing the application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open a command-line interface or terminal.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the application.

## Additional Notes

- Task Storage: The application uses pickle serialization to store the tasks in a file called "tasks.pkl". This file will be created in the same directory as the application file. Please ensure that the application has read and write permissions in the current directory.
- Dependencies: The application does not have any external dependencies and only requires Python 3.x to be installed.
